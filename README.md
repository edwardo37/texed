# texed -- a text editor made by a beginner

This is my first hard-and-fast project. I know basic terminal programs but I want to go beyond.



I want to do a couple things with this project:

- Learn how C libraries and C++ code should interact (in this case, ncurses).

- Work backwards. Start with C++ STL conviniences (string, vector, etc.) and work backwards into more simple classes that conform to my needs.

- Learn proper version control.

- Learn concepts like file paging, buffering, input handling, exception handling.

- Learn how build systems work.

- Go beyond the simple terminal program into a real user experience.

- Learn proper software architecture -- planning, implementation, etc.



My programming experience thus far (September 2025):

- Lots of tinkering with scripts in Python and Bash, up to file and object manipulation.

- A couple programming classes in college each with complementary projects (Intro, C++, .NET, web dev, etc.).
